# Sentiment Analysis of Rotten Tomatoes Review Using Transfer Learning

A Sentiment Analysis performed on 100,000 Rotten Tomatoes Critic Reviews.

FastAi library (which is based on Pytorch) was used to perform this task, we achieved approx 85% accuracy when predicting the sentiment of a review. It was a binary classification problem with responses ("Rotten", "Fresh").

Since the dataset is too big to put up on a Personal GitHub, some data exploration has been done in the notebook to show what kind of data we are dealing with and other such basic EDA we perform on any dataset.
